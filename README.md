# Z80 fig-FORTH 1.3

> <h2><i>figForth Refuses to Die<sup>1</sup></i></h2>   
<br/>    
A fig-FORTH<sup>2</sup> implementation for the Z80 that can be built using TASM<sup>3</sup>:
   
```
$ tasm -80 -b figforth.asm forth.com forth.lst
```

Alternatively, non-Windows users can use the `uz80as`<sup>4</sup> Z80 compiler.

The resulting `forth.com` executable can be run in CP/M. For example<sup>5</sup>:
```
A>FORTH ↵

Z80 fig-FORTH 1.3c
: CUBE ( N -> N.  CUBE A NUMBER ) ↵
   DUP DUP  ( NOW THERE ARE THREE COPIES ) ↵
   * * ↵
; ↵ ok
5 CUBE . 125 ↵ ok
-28 CUBE . ↵ -21952 ok
HEX 17 CUBE BINARY . DECIMAL ↵ 10111110000111 ok
BYE ↵

```

## Custom Words
This fig-FORTH implementation includes the following custom words<sup>6</sup>:

`(OF)`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` n1 n2 --- n1 ` _(if no match)_   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` n1 n2 --- ` _(if there is a match)_  
<ul>
The run-time procedure compiled by `OF`. See the description of the 
run-time behaviour of `OF`.
</ul>

`CASE`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` --- addr n ` _(compiling)_   
<ul>
Used in a colon definition in the form: `CASE...OF...ENDOF...ENDCASE`.
Note that `OF ... ENDOF` pairs may be repeated as necessary.

At compile time `CASE` saves the current value of `CSP` and resets
it to the current position of the stack. This information is used
by `ENDCASE` to resolve forward references left on the stack by any
`ENDOF`s which precede it. `n` is left for compiler error checking.

`CASE` has no run-time effects.
</ul>

`ENDCASE`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` addr1...addrn n --- ` _(compiling)_   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` n --- ` _(if no match)_   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` --- ` _(if a match was found)_   
<ul>
Used in a colon definition in the form: `CASE...OF...ENDOF...ENDCASE`.
Note that `OF ... ENDOF` pairs may be repeated as necessary.

At run-time, `ENDCASE` drops the select value if it does not equal any
case values.  `ENDCASE` then serves as the destination of forward
branches from all previous `ENDOF`s.

At compile-time. `ENDCASE` compiles a `DROP` then computes forward 
branch offsets until all addresses left by previous `ENDOF`s have been
resolved. Finally, the value of `CSP` saved by `CASE` is restored. `n`
is used for error checking.
</ul>

`ENDOF`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` addr1 n1 --- addr2  n2 ` _(compiling)_   
<ul>
Used in a colon definition in the form: `CASE...OF...ENDOF...ENDCASE`.
Note that `OF ... ENDOF` pairs may be repeated as necessary.

At run-time, `ENDOF` transfers control to the code following the next
`ENDCASE` provided there was a match at the last `OF`. If the was no
match at the last `OF`, `ENDOF` is the location to which execution
will branch.

At compile-time `ENDOF` emplaces `BRANCH` reserving a branch offset,
leaves the address `addr2` and `n2` for error checking. `ENDOF` also
resolves the pending forward branch from `OF` by calculating the offset
from `addr1` to `HERE` and storing it at `addr1`.
</ul>

`FILE`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` cccc `   
<ul>
Close the current .SCR file, and opens the given file. Note that a 
file can be loaded automatically on startup by specifying its name on 
the command line, e.g. `FORTH SCREENS.SCR`. Startup will be aborted 
with a `No File` error message if the file cannot be opened.
</ul>

`FTYPE`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` --- addr `   
<ul>
A constant containing the three character file type used by `FILE`.   
Defaults to **.SCR**.
</ul>

`OF`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` --- addr  n ` _(compiling)_   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` n1 n2 --- n1 ` _(if no match)_   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` n1 n2 --- ` _(if there is a match)_   
<ul>
Used in a colon definition in the form: `CASE...OF...ENDOF...ENDCASE`.
Note that `OF ... ENDOF` pairs may be repeated as necessary.

At run-time, `OF` checks `n1` and `n2` for equality. If equal, `n1` and `n2`
are both dropped from the stack, and execution continues to the next `ENDOF`.
If not equal, only `n2` is dropped, and execution jumps to whatever follows
the next `ENDOF`.
</ul>

## RomWBW extensions
Support for RomWBW HBIOS features<sup>7</sup> is included when fig-FORTH 
is built with the `-DROMWBW` flag:

`.B`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` n -- `   
<ul>
Print a BCD value, converted to decimal. No following blank is printed.
</ul>

`AT`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` col row --- `   
<ul>
Position the text cursor at the given position. Both column and 
row positions are zero indexed, thus `0 0 AT` will move the cursor
to the top left. Note that `AT` does *not* update `OUT`.
</ul>

`CLS`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` --- `   
<ul>
Clear VDU screen.
</ul>

`KEY?`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` --- c t ¦ f `   
<ul>
Check if a key has been pressed. Returns false if no key has been
pressed. Returns true and the key's ascii code if a key has been
pressed. 
</ul>

`STIME`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` addr --- `   
<ul>
Set the RTC time. addr is the address of the 6 byte date/time buffer, 
YMDHMS. Each byte is BCD encoded.
</ul>

`TIME`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` --- addr `   
<ul>
Get the RTC time and leave the address of the 6 byte date/time buffer, 
YMDHMS. Each byte is BCD encoded.
</ul>

## fig-FORTH Editor
The fig-FORTH EDITOR<sup>8</sup> is included in the `SCREENS.SCR` file:
```

## fig-FORTH 8080/Z80 Assembler
The fig-FORTH assembler enables the creation of both full and defining 
words using assembly language. 

The assembler is invoked using `CODE`, which creates a dictionary entry 
with given name and then assembles the mnemonics following. The mnemonics
are based on the 8080 instruction set with Z80 specific extensions. 
The assembly code must end with `PCIX` to ensure control is returned to Forth. 

Note that Forth postfix notation applies between opcodes and operands.

```
CODE FOO  ( n1 n2 -- n3 as sum of n1 + n2 )
  H POP   ( get first number from stack   )
  D POP   ( get second number from stack  )
  D DAD   ( add hl and de, result in hl   )
  H PUSH  ( push result to top of stack   )
  PCIX    ( jump to NEXT                  )
C;  ( end of definition, return to FORTH  )
```

The following rules apply when creating words using the assembler:

1. The `BC` register pair must be preserved across words.
1. Avoid use of the Z80 alternative register set.
1. Do NOT use the `IY` or `IX` registers, which are used by fig-FORTH to
keep track of the inner interpreter routine.
1. Definitions must end with `PCIX` (cf. `JNEXT` in `figforth.asm`) or 
`PCIY` (cf. `JHPUSH`).

Additionally, the assembler performs minimal checks which means that it is 
easy to create illegal instructions, resulting in systems hangs or crashes.
